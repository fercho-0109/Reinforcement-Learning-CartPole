# Reinforcement-Learning-CartPole

"A. Marino, - Clasic control using RL for a Cartpole system".  
Code based from https://github.com/nicknochnack  
For any questions or suggestions write to alexismarino0109@gmail.com

## Summary.
This is the classic example of reinforcement learning in which an agent has to learn to keep a pole stable. The algorithm is developed by taking advantage of the versatility of the stable Baselines3 library. Using PPO RL algorithm. it is programmed using a Jupyter notebook 
https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/

## Run
- To run the algorithm,  create a folder Training containing 2 folders: Logs and Saved model
